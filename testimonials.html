"I think it would be an understatement just to say that Don's seminar was a huge success. His presentation was clear and concise, and some of the jigs he presented were just genius. The seminar probably saved me years of trial and error in trying to imagine 'how'd he do that?' It was the best seminar I've ever attended."
<br />Len Walko, Brush Prairie, Wa.


<P> "Don, thank you for a very informative two days of instruction. I plan on attending the dovetail and chair classes….has definitely increased my knowledge significantly." <br /> Gig Lewis, Beaverton, Or.



<P>"Don, Did not know what to expect, the information and workmanship level met my highest expectations."
<br />Joe Von Arx, Auburn, Ca. 



<P>"Fantastic one-on-one instruction on the Demilune Table class, this class taught me many of the advanced techniques that I have long aspired to learn, but didn't know where to start. I would recommend this class to anyone that wants to be able to create something extraordinary. I now feel confident enough to introduce advanced veneer, inlay and curve techniques into my woodworking."
<br />Todd Solomon, San Jose, Ca.



<P>"I wanted to tell you how much I enjoyed your program and how much I learned! You did a great job with the organization, depth of coverage and completeness. Thanks for a really informative day."
<br />Jerry Work, Kerby, Or.



<P>"I have taken classes with a number of world class instructors here in the Northwest. I got more from Don's than any of the others. His presentation is fact packed, thoughtful and well delivered. I can't wait to take another class with him." 
<br />Tony Scolaro, Rogue River, Or.



<P>"The class was one I deeply enjoyed. I think Don did a great job in structuring the class and having a number of partial assemblies ready so the class could see the results of the procedures….I am sure I will be using some of the techniques that he developed."
<br />John Jury, Ashland, Or.



<P>"He does a first rate job of showing all the steps necessary to build one of his fabulous tables. I could not more highly recommend this class to anyone who shares a love for what a master craftsman can create."
<br />Jerry Work, Kerby, Or.



<P>"I greatly enjoyed your chair seminar and know I will use many of the techniques and ideas I picked up…having taught high school cabinetmaking I can appreciate all the work I know it took for you to put together the presentation. Thank you for the great seminar. I would highly recommend it and would like to be on your mailing list for future seminars." <br />Larry Books, Battle Ground, Wa.



<P>"I took your course on chair making and I want you to know how enjoyable and how well it was organized…your measurement techniques make so much sense and your chair box really simplifies the complexity of compound angles. Thanks again for your class. As I prepare to build my first chair I do feel confident that I can build a quality chair." <br />Norm Michaud, Oregon



<P>"I really enjoyed the chair class and found it to be quite valuable. I really liked your many approaches for speeding up the process without compromising the quality of the end result. You clearly strive for fine details and I appreciate that. For me it also provided considerable inspiration. 
<br />Bob Williams, Portland, Or.



<P>"I have been to a lot of seminars that were often too difficult to follow as the presenter rambled on, your presentation was easy to follow…the demonstrations for cutting out, glue-up etc. gave me the information without going into windy detail…the shop tips such as your resaw fence, router jigs and the leg box will help me with many projects to come. All in all it was one of the best seminars I have ever been to! Thanks"
<br />Steve Philps



<P>"I wanted to congratulate Don on a fantastic seminar. I learned a great deal and left excited about trying some of the techniques. Don was a fantastic teacher. I encourage everyone to look at the other classes. This is a great way to learn new techniques." <br />Al Doughty, Portland, Or.



<P>"I would like to say how impressed we all were with the presentation, you left a lasting impact on us all. Your presentation was well organized with pieces in varying stages of completion. Thank you for a job well done." 
<br />Sid Sutherland, Brush Prairie, Wa.



<P>"Don's dining table class is amongst the very best of classes I have attended either here in the U.S. or in England…he covers a wide range of fine woodworking techniques and a wealth of his own methods and jigs…..Highly recommended." 
<br />Ian Walton, Grants Pass, Or



<P>"I am SO glad I attended this workshop! Loads of information, lots of small tips, the jigs were ingenious and the table was a marvel of craftsmanship. Very inspirational, this will definitely yield enormous benefits for me and my work. Kudos to Don, I would not hesitate to take another class from him."
<br />Bill Mitchell, Portland, Or.


<P>"My first impressions left me with the feeling that you were extremely well prepared and had a firm grasp of the subjects you dealt with. I had the sense that you knew what you were talking about and had no difficulty explaining things. It was excellent that you provided each student with a binder filled with diagrams and explanations that we could refer to when discussions got complex and technical. I thought you were quite clear and the progression of steps were right on. It was good that you had the finished piece with you in addition to all the in progress and sample pieces. Quite thorough. I enjoyed seeing all the different jigs that you made and how you use them. That alone was worth the cost of admission! It's always good to see how other people solve problems. Trust me, I learned a lot! A terrific seminar and a superb job."
<br />Peter Loh, Portland, Or.
