                <p>"I think it would be an understatement just to say that Don's seminar was a huge success. His presentation was clear and concise, and some of the jigs he presented were just genius. The seminar probably saved me years of trial and error in trying to imagine 'how'd he do that?' It was the best seminar I've ever attended."</p>

                <p>"Fantastic one-on-one instruction on the Demilune Table class, this class taught me many of the advanced techniques that I have long aspired to learn, but didn't know where to start. I would recommend this class to anyone that wants to be able to create something extraordinary. I now feel confident enough to introduce advanced veneer, inlay and curve techniques into my woodworking."</p>

                <p>"I have been to a lot of seminars that were often too difficult to follow as the presenter rambled on, your presentation was easy to follow...the demonstrations for cutting out, glue-up etc. gave me the information without going into windy detail...the shop tips such as your resaw fence, router jigs and the leg box will help me with many projects to come. All in all it was one of the best seminars I have ever been to! Thanks"</p>

                <p>"Don's dining table class is amongst the very best of classes I have attended either here in the U.S. or in England...he covers a wide range of fine woodworking techniques and a wealth of his own methods and jigs.....Highly recommended."</p>

                <p>"My first impressions left me with the feeling that you were extremely well prepared and had a firm grasp of the subjects you dealt with. I had the sense that you knew what you were talking about and had no difficulty explaining things. It was excellent that you provided each student with a binder filled with diagrams and explanations that we could refer to when discussions got complex and technical. I thought you were quite clear and the progression of steps were right on. It was good that you had the finished piece with you in addition to all the in progress and sample pieces. Quite thorough. I enjoyed seeing all the different jigs that you made and how you use them. That alone was worth the cost of admission! It's always good to see how other people solve problems. Trust me, I learned a lot! A terrific seminar and a superb job."</p>
