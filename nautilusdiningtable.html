            <p>I made this table for my wife last year. It has two leaves which are stored inside the table. The sunburst pattern on the top required 32 consecutive leaves of American Walnut. The field is surrounded with a Bubinga crossbanding. Bubinga is also used for the bead at the bottom of each apron as well as the crown and flutes in each leg. The crown is at the transition point where the leg changes from the square top into a tapered hex. Each of the six faces has a flute which is plunged into the Bubinga layer under the original Walnut. The solid Walnut rim has a rippled look due to the Curly Walnut used. The apron and legs are also of Curly Walnut.</p>
            <p>The table in the closed position seats eight. With both leaves installed it seats twelve comfortably. Notice in the fully extended photo, that the base is fixed and only the top slides to accommodate four additional diners outside of the legs. By not cutting the apron in mid span, the mechanical integrity of the apron is preserved and the table will not sag over time, a common problem with expandable dining tables.</p>
