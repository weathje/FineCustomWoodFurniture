This cabinet was for a client that was intimately involved in the design process. Once again, their input took me into uncharted waters in the evolution of the final design. I was particularly pleased with the final outcome, and have had a lot of positive feedback.
<p>
The Bolivian Rosewood sunburst fan was particularly difficult. To center the fan, I had to shift the layout of each individual leaf. In a bundle of consecutive veneers, the difference in the grain pattern between the first and the last leaf is usually quite significant. This shifting of the grain pattern in the sunburst is what adds visual interest to the final fan. However, the pattern also shifts from the ends of each leaf as you go down through the stack. If not dealt with the result is a lopsided pinwheel effect of the fan. Removing this end shift requires some math. Measuring the shift between the first and last leaves may be as much as a foot! That number is then divided by the total number of sheets. The resulting small increment is then applied to each leaf, gradually shifting the layout of each leaf. This technique requires buying the raw veneers in longer bundles than needed.
<p>
The sunburst is surrounded by a Macassar Ebony crossbanding. This same detail is in the deep bevel at the foot/leg transition. A Wenge bead finishes the door edges as well as the side panels. A Bloodwood string inlay detail adorns the legs and feet. It also defines the field from the rim on the top. The doors are bent laminations in a sine curve across the front of the cabinet.
<p>
I would like to thank the Hibbards for the opportunity to build this fine piece.
