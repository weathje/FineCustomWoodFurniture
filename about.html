                                <p>I was one of those fortunate high school students to have a gifted shop teacher who taught a geometric approach to woodworking, rather than simply machine operations. As a firefighter in San Jose, CA, my 24-hour shifts left plenty of time for my growing love of woodworking, and over those 25 years, I built and sold many pieces. Now in retirement, I can pursue the craft full-time.</p>

                                <p>Initially, I found that I was allowing my joinery to dictate my designs, producing boxy and amateur-looking pieces. Also being a frugal woodworker, I was letting the material dictate the proportions, simply because I didn't want to "waste" wood. I finally came to the conclusion that what I really lacked was some design education.</p>

                                <p>In my quest for "design knowledge," I undertook a year apprenticeship through the Baulines Guild with master craftsman Roger Heitzman in Scotts Valley, CA. Although it wasn't cheap, it was the best money that I ever spent. I had always thought that a good designer just had a good eye and instinctually knew what looked good. Instead, I found that good design is a learned discipline. One such lesson was the benefit of veneer. Though I had always thought that solid wood was the mark of quality, Roger pointed out how restrictive solid wood was to design-the wood grain runs either lengthwise or across.</p>

                                <p>Veneer, on the other hand, opens an unlimited vista of design options without the problems of wood movement-and it certainly has expanded my palette. I particularly love to utilize slip matched, radial patterns, allowing the subtle changes in the grain patterns to create a form of animation as eyes move across the piece (as seen in the <a class="mi" href="demilune.html"><strong>Demilune Table</strong></a>).</p>

                                <p>But don't get me wrong. I still do plenty of solid wood construction for clients (such as the <a class="mi" href="cocobolatable.html"><strong>Cocobolo Dining Table</strong></a>). As the world's exotic forests continue to shrink, veneer is becoming a better environmental choice, and some of the veneer houses, like the Alpi Group, have been perfecting a dying process that colors the veneer all the way through the leaf. In some instances, the finished product is better than the real thing, if you could find it.</p>

                                <img src="images/about_don2.jpg" alt="Seminars in Precision Woodwork by Don DeDobbeleer, Fine Custom Wood Furniture" align="left" class="hspace-10 vspace-10">

                                <p>Not satisfied with most commercial products, I have been re-sawing my own veneers from thick stock to thicknesses that will allow refinishing many times over the piece's long life. Sawing, instead of slicing the veneers, introduces a slight change from one veneer to the next, which results in an unpredictable pattern in a slip matched, radial sunburst that can be especially pleasing to the eye.</p>

                                <p>Although I enjoy experimenting with my own designs, I find that working with clients, who have their own ideas, can sometimes lead to unimagined design options.</p>

                                <p>I have tried several times to learn computer design programs, but most of my drawings are still done the old-fashioned way, with pencil and paper. After I finish the preliminary sketch, I usually build a mock-up of junk wood and hot glue. I paint the mock-up a flat white and set it beside my television. During the commercial breaks, I study it and usually am able to determine what is wrong with the form. Back at the shop, I disassemble it with a hot putty knife and make changes. Over a period of time, I will refine the lines and curves, as well as the dimensions of various components.</p>

                                <p>In 1999, I moved to Etna, a small town in Northern California, and joined the Siskiyou Woodcraft Guild, where I have enjoyed the company of the other woodworkers and attend wood shows in Ashland, OR. In 2004, I entered some pieces in my first big show, Portland's <strong>Best of the Northwest.</strong> To my amazement, I won the <strong>Best of Show</strong> and a <strong>Peer Award</strong> for my <a class="mi" href="demilune.html"><strong>Demilune Table</strong></a> and received requests to teach classes for the Guild of Oregon Woodworkers.</p>

                                <p>I have found teaching both rewarding and difficult. Trying to do complicated machine operations, while interacting with students, is a sure way to divide your concentration. For the Oregon Guild, I have taught workshops on constructing a <a class="mi" href="demilune.html"><strong>Demilune Table</strong></a> and dining room chairs, and I am contemplating another class in the Fall.</p>

                                            <p>A day at the Demilune class at Len Walco's shop for the Guild of Oregon Woodworkers. This was the first of two days of intensive instruction. Here I am clamping up the apron on a curved form in what is called a bent lamination. After drying, the apron will be cut into three pieces; the center one will be cut into the five pieces to form a drawer with very small margins. A very brittle adhesive is used so there will be no spring back once the lamination is removed from the bending form.</p>

                                            <p>The veneers are laid out in a radial or sunburst pattern, in what I call a slip match. This is the first time you get to see the potential of a given set. Some times I am expecting a really spectacular set and it just fails to happen. Other times, wow! It turns out fantastic. A bookmatch pattern can be predicted with the use of a hinged mirror, but the slip match is a wild card every time!</p>
